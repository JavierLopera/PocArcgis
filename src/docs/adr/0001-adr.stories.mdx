# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-03-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to disable the Shadow-DOM because we having some problems with the massive imports of the styles.

## Decision

We disabled Shadow-DOM encapsulation in favor of use 'scoped' option.

## Consequences

We give up total encapsulation, but we manage to prevent massive injection of styles. We must have more control over styles to prevent collisions.
